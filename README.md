#### This programe was uesd before for datasets construction in all my works and my research group mate
#### Besides this version, the series of deformation and other information can also be extracted (will be uploaded after)

#### This programe can extract the springback and section information for the txt(conversed by inp)
#### Note: the inp should follow the modeling method in this git (https://github.com/sooncheer0420/Batch_Simulation_for_bent_tube_and_springback_after)
#### This program is an example for batch extraction, and the example of resource are given
